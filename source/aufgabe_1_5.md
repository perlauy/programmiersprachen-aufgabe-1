# Aufgabe 1.5

### Initialise:
It is to give (assign) a variable an initial value. It can be done together with its declaration (when we introduce the name and type to the program). For example:
```int my_variable = 1;```

### Assign:
This same variable can be given later a different value: that is assigning.
For example, to the same variable above, we change the value from 1 to 5:
```my_variable = 5;```
The difference between the examples is that to assign a value we do not state the type, as it was already defined during the variable's declaration (and its initialization).
